## Installation
The project requires some dependencies to be installed. You can install them by running the following command:
```bash
brew install aerospace sketchybar borders
```

Also, you would need to make the shell scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x sketchybar/plugins/*
chmod +x sketchybar/colors.sh
```
You might have to run this in sudo mode.
